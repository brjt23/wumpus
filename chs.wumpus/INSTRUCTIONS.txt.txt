Welcome to the Wumpus game! 
First of all, if you want to configure the game you can edit the file
“config.properties” located at .\src\main\resources. This configuration 
contains four fields:
-Width: the with of the board
-Height: the height of the board
-Holes: the number of holes to allocate in the board
-Arrows: the amount of arrows the hunter has
They’re all integer values and you can change them in order to configure
the game.

Once the game is configured and you start the game you’ll see the main 
menu. There you can choose among different options by writing the 
character that represents the command and pressing enter key. 
For example, given the main menu: Select the next action you 
wanna do:
- g: Go forward.
- l: Turn 90º to the left
- r: Turn 90º to the right
- a: Use an arrow
- f: Leave the dungeon
- q: Quit the game

If you select the command “g”(or G accepts both lower and upper case) 
the hunter will move one step on the current orientation of the hunter. 
The hunter always turns 90(right or left) so there are only four possible
orientations. To turn the hunter to its right you can use command “r”
and to turn it left the command “l”. The hunter can also use a limited
amount of arrows(that you can configure at config.properties). To use
an arrow you use the command “a”.  The arrow will go on until it crashes 
into a wall or kills the wumpus.. Using “f” when you are on the initial position
you leave the dungeon, if you leave with the gold you win. if you’re tired to 
play and you wanna quit you can use command “q” and game will end.

While the hunter is moving it will run into different events, if you find the
cell that contains the gold it will automatically be added to the hunter’s bag,
but if you find the wumpus or you fall into a hole the hunter will dye and
the game will end up. 

Be aware that you don’t see the map so you will need to remember your 
steps if you wanna leave the dungeon alive and with the gold.

That’s all LET’S PLAY WUMPUS!!
